        <p class="abb">Coding is the fundamental skill for jobs such as software development. There is currently a
            shortage of software developers worldwide, so learning to code can be an easy route into an open field of
            work. However, this isn’t the only way coding can open up job opportunities.

            For smaller start-ups, hiring someone solely to take care of coding and web design may not be the most
            economically viable choice. Having coding as a string to your bow can be key to finding jobs related to the
            field (like content creation, marketing, PR and more).

            Even if you’re applying for a position which has no direct relevancy to coding, it’s still well known as a
            useful skill. Thus, by having any knowledge of it, you’ll automatically give yourself a foot up on the
            competition. On top of it being a generally worthwhile skill in most jobs, it also shows that you’re
            hardworking, dynamic, and a self-starter.

            Knowledge of coding (or, as some call it, coding literacy) can help in other ways, too. It can mean you are
            quicker to learn other aspects or tech, plus mean you are more digitally fluent. In today’s ever more
            digital job market, this can only be of benefit.
